# Node.Js Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning journey with Node.js, including code examples, notes, and projects.

### Projects (Coming Soon)
I'll be adding projects once I complete certain modules.

### Naming Conventions

For better organization, I follow these naming conventions:
- **Modules**: `Module_01`, `Module_02`, etc. followed by the module topic
- **Chapters**: `CH 01`, `CH 02`, etc. followed by the topic name
- **Class Notes**: `CN_01`, `CN_02`, etc. followed by the topic
- **Projects**: `Project_01`, `Project_02`, etc. followed by the project name
