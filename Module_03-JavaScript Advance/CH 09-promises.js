/*
 * Promises in JavaScript:
 * - Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.
 * - They simplify writing asynchronous code, avoiding "callback hell" and resolves problem of IOC. 
 * - Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. They are returned immediately after calling. 
 * - Promise will act as a placeholder for the data we hope to get back sometime in future.
 * - Promise cretion is synchronous in nature as it's native to js.
 * - Once the future task done is the promises will automatically execute the attached functionality.
 * - With whatever argument we pass in the 'resolve'/'reject' function during promise creation will be assigned as
 *   value of that promise.
 * - Promise will stay in pending state if not called 'reject'/'resolve'
 * 
 *  Common Use Cases of Promises:
 *  -----------------------------
 *  -> Fetching Data from APIs
 *  -> Reading Files Asynchronously
 *  -> Executing Multiple Asynchronous Operations Concurrently
 *  -> Chaining Dependent Asynchronous Operations
 *  -> Handling Animations or Timed Events
 *  -> Loading External Scripts or Resources

/**
 * Consuming Promises using then(resolveHandler, rejectionHandler)
 * 
 * In JavaScript, Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations.
 * The `.then()` method takes two optional arguments:
 *    - resolveHandler ‚Üí called when the promise is fulfilled
 *    - rejectionHandler ‚Üí called when the promise is rejected
 *
 * Syntax:
 *    promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
 *
 * Note:
 * - You can use one or both arguments.
 * - It‚Äôs better practice to use `.catch()` for error handling, 
 *   but this example shows direct use of both handlers inside `.then()`.
